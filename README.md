#Netflix Analysis Project

📄 Project Description
This project is my first hands-on attempt at applying data analysis and visualization techniques to the Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset. Using Python and its powerful libraries, I explored the data to uncover trends, insights, and hidden patterns within Netflix's offerings.

The project covers:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Visualization of Key Insights

The goal is to develop practical data analysis skills while gaining valuable insights into Netflix's catalog.

🔍 Key Insights
Content Type: The distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows on Netflix.
Genres: Most common genres and trends over the years.
Release Trends: How Netflix's content production has evolved over time.
Cast Analysis: Popular actors featured in Netflix content.
Content Ratings: Classification of Netflix content by maturity ratings.

🚀 Technologies Used
Google Colab: For running the Python code.
Python Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
NumPy: Data processing.
